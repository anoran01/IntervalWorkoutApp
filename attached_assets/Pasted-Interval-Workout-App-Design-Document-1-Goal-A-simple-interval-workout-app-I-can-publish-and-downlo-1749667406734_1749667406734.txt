Interval Workout App Design Document
1. Goal: A simple interval workout app I can publish and download on iOS.
2. Features: 
- A quick menu to generate a standard interval workout
- An ability to name and save that workout
- ability to customize the timers of the generated workout, or add new timers as needed
- two simple menus: one for the workout generation, a second for selecting workouts
- In each workout is a settings button that allows you to edit the timers or edit the sounds made during the workout
- What I'm trying to generate might be called a Tabata?
- The quick menu needs the following settings:
    -- Prepare, Work, Rest, Rounds (One each of work + rest), Cycles (# of rounds), Rest between cycles
    -- possible more settings for the sound effects (beep tone, # of beeps, halfway reminder, 10 second reminder)
- The app needs to work without dimming the sounds of other apps playing in the background (podcasts, music). Other apps I've tried that did dimming effects worked weird and caused weird things to happen that I don't like.
- The sound effect settings need to be able to set different tones for beeps, when does the beeping start (once per second until end of work/rest)
- There should be a sound effect option for a "halfway" reminder for either work or rest
- Two menu options: Quick Menu and Workout List both in tabs at bottom 10-20% of screen. Top 80-90% is the quick menu or the workout list or the timer list for a specific workout.
- If there are settings to adjust on a whole workout basis where are those accessed? A 3 dot settings menu in the top right of a workout.
    -- The name of the workout will be at the top with a pencil button to rename at right. To the right of the pencil button can be the settings menu
    -- back button at top left to go back to workout list
    -- Where would a play button be located? A big play button at the top below the name but above the list of timers.
    -- Every work/rest timer should be able to be renamed (can an AI say the names of the exercises?) before clicking play
- Vibrate on timer change option should exist.
- Default name of workout is Temp Workout.
    -- Need some kind of check for unique workout names.
- When a workout is playing it should be a list and each workout drains a bar with a timer at far right. Then you can see what is coming up. Once a quick workout is generated it should just be a list of work and rest sessions so the timer won't necessarily know what is a round or cycle, jsut work and rest.
    -- Once a full workout is finished should there be a final sound or voiceover that plays: "Workout Finished"
    -- For the list idea, once a timer is finished it should vanish upwards and the entire list moves up, so the current timer is always at the top.
- Black backgrounds, distinct orange and blue colors for work and rest timers. White timer number at far right during a workout. Color drains out of timers showing a white border with the black background behind. White text.
- Option for light mode which flips black backgroudn to white and white text to black. Keeps orange/blue the same or changes them so that they seem the same on the lighter background.
